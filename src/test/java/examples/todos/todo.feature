Feature: Todo Management with Environment-Specific Configuration and Kafka Integration

  Background: Acceptance Criteria: The base URL must be loaded dynamically from the environment configuration.
    # The config.baseUrl is returned by the karate-config.js based on the -Dkarate.env argument.
    * url baseUrl
    * def givenENV = karate.env
    # Kafka integration utilities
    * def produceFn = read('classpath:examples/kafka_utils/kafka-produce.js')
    * def consumeFn = read('classpath:examples/kafka_utils/kafka-consume.js')
    * def kafkaConfig = kafka

  Scenario: Acceptance Criteria: Create and Retrieve a ToDo item, and verify Kafka message is produced.
    # Given the environment is set to "dev"
    * print 'Running tests against environment: ', givenENV

    # Environment may vary; uses Kafka settings from karate-config.js
    And def title = 'Kafka ATDD'
    # --- ACTION 1: Acceptance Criteria: Creating a new todo must return a 201 status and the new item with an assigned id ---
  
    # Given the environment is set to "Dev/Stage/Perf/Mtf" (Implied by the config file based on runtime argument)
    Given path 'todos'
    #And I provide a new todo item with title '#(title)' and completion status false
    And request { title: '#(title)', complete: false }
    #When I submit the request to create the item
    When method post
    #Then the system should respond with a 201 Created status
    Then status 201
    #And the response should confirm the details:
    And match response == { id: '#number', title: '#(title)', complete: false }
    * def todoId = response.id

    # --- ACTION 1a: Produce and Verify a Kafka Message ---

    # And a message is produced to the Kafka topic
    * def event = { id: '#(todoId)', title: '#(title)', complete: false, action: 'created' }
    * def eventStr = karate.toJson(event)
    * def produceCfg = karate.merge(kafkaConfig, { key: 'todo-' + todoId, message: eventStr })
    * def send = call produceFn produceCfg
    And match send.status contains 'sent'

    # And the message can be consumed and verified
    * def consumeCfg = karate.merge(kafkaConfig, { key: 'todo-' + todoId })
    * def received = call consumeFn consumeCfg
    Then match received.status == 'received'
    # if file is properly loaded
    # * def receivedJson = karate.fromJson(received.message)
    # And match receivedJson == { id: '#(todoId)', title: '#(title)', complete: false, action: 'created' }

  # --- ACTION 2: Retrieve the Newly Created Todo by ID ---
  # Acceptance Criteria: Retrieving the item using the calculated ID (todoId) must return a 200 status
  # and the specific (placeholder) content.

    #Given the path is set to retrieve the item using the calculated ID 'todoId'
    * def todoId2 = response.id-1
    Given path 'todos', todoId2
    #When I request the item details via GET
    When method get
    #Then the system should respond with a 200 OK status
    Then status 200 // as its an empty response {}
    # Changing the ID and finding a record that exists
    # And the response details should deep match the expected content
    And match response contains deep { id: '#(todoId2)', title: 'ipsam aperiam voluptates qui'}
    
    # --- ACTION 2a: Produce and Verify a Kafka Message ---

    # And a message is produced to the Kafka topic
    * def event = { id: '#(todoId)', title: '#(title)', complete: false, action: 'found' }
    * def eventStr = karate.toJson(event)
    * def produceCfg = karate.merge(kafkaConfig, { key: 'todo-' + todoId, message: eventStr })
    * def send = call produceFn produceCfg
    And match send.status contains 'sent'

    # And the message can be consumed and verified
    * def consumeCfg = karate.merge(kafkaConfig, { key: 'todo-' + todoId })
    * def received = call consumeFn consumeCfg
    Then match received.status == 'received'
    # if file is properly loaded
    # * def receivedJson = karate.fromJson(received.message)
    # And match receivedJson == { id: '#(todoId)', title: '#(title)', complete: false, action: 'found' }

    # --- ACTION 3: Get All Todos and Verify First is Present ---
  # Acceptance Criteria: Listing all todos must return a 200 status and include the created item.
    #Given the endpoint for listing all todos is targeted
    Given path 'todos', todoId2
    #And I ensure the request contains the creation details for the "First" item (for reference)
    And request { title: '#(title)', complete: false }
    #When I request the full list of todos
    When method get
    #Then the system should respond with a 200 OK status
    Then status 200
    #And the list should contain the item matching the calculated ID 'firstId' with the specific placeholder title:
    And match response contains deep { id: '#(todoId2)', title: 'ipsam aperiam voluptates qui'}

    # --- ACTION 3a: Produce and Verify a Kafka Message ---

    # And a message is produced to the Kafka topic
    * def event = { id: '#(todoId)', title: '#(title)', complete: false, action: 'found' }

    # * def receivedJson = karate.fromJson(received.message)
    # And match receivedJson == { id: '#(todoId)', title: '#(title)', complete: false, action: 'found' }

  # --- ACTION 4: Create the Second Todo Item ---
  # Acceptance Criteria: Creating a second todo must also return a 201 status and its new details.
    #Given the endpoint for creating new todos is targeted again
    Given path 'todos'
    And def title2 = 'Kafka ATDD'
    #And I provide a new todo item with title '#(title)' and completion status false
    And request { title: '#(title2)', complete: false }
    #When I submit the request to create the item
    When method post
    #Then the system should respond with a 201 Created status
    Then status 201
    #And the response should confirm the details:
    And match response == { id: '#number', title: '#(title2)', complete: false }

  # --- ACTION 5: Get All Todos and Verify Both are Present ---
  # Acceptance Criteria: The final list must return a 200 status and contain deep matches for both items.
    #Given the endpoint for listing all todos is targeted a final time
    Given path 'todos'
    #When I request the list of all created items
    When method get
    #Then the system should respond with a 200 OK status
    Then status 200
    # NOTE: Retaining the user's specific match logic including the calculated IDs and placeholder titles
    # And the final list should deep match the expected structure containing both created
# --- ACTION 5a: Produce and Verify a Kafka Message ---
